    <h2>What is DevOps</h2>
    <p>
      DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools
      that increases an organizationâ€™s ability to deliver applications and
      services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster
      pace than organizations using traditional software development and
      infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to
      better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.
